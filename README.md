# Data-port
Hope all is well! My name is Devin Inthavongsa. I am a current medical researcher jumping into the ocean of data analysis, with future aspirations in data science. I have a background in biomedical science, earning both my bachelor's and master's degree within that field. Most of what I know about data analysis and data science are either self-taught or learned through courses I think are interesting on the internet.
